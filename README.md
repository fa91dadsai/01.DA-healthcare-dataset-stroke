# Insights into Stroke Healthcare Data 📊🏥

Welcome to my latest data science project, where I've delved into the intricate world of stroke healthcare data, uniting the realms of data analysis and machine learning to uncover valuable insights.

## Project Highlights 🌟
1. **Data Exploration:** Using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, I meticulously dissected the dataset, unraveling its intricacies and subtleties.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Employing rigorous data-cleaning techniques, I addressed missing values, outliers, and irrelevant columns, ensuring the utmost data precision.

3. **Machine Learning:** I constructed predictive models with a range of algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest, leading to highly accurate stroke predictions.

4. **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn were invaluable in visualizing the data, facilitating the identification of pivotal insights and emerging trends.
